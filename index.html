                1. Adaptability: Holsteins thrive in various climates, contributing to their widespread popularity.
                They can adapt well to different environmental conditions2.
                <br>
                2. Robust Health: While not immune to health issues, Holsteins are generally healthy and robust cows
                <br>
                3. High Fertility: These cows reach puberty earlier and have higher fertility rates.
                <br>
                4. Good Health and Longevity: Jerseys tend to be hardy and live longer.
                <br>
                5. Environmentally Friendly: Their efficient feed conversion and smaller size make them
                environmentally
                friendly.

            </td>
            <td>
                1. Feed Conversion Efficiency: Jerseys are efficient at converting their food intake into milk
                production. This means they cost less to feed and still produce high-quality milk1
                <br>
                2. Producing Nutrient-Rich Milk: Jersey milk is rich in nutrients. Compared to average milk, it
                contains 15% to 20% more protein, 15% to 18% more calcium, and 10% to 12% more phosphorus.
                Additionally, it has higher levels of essential vitamin B1212
                <br>
                3. A2 Beta-Casein Proteins: Jersey milk contains A2 beta-casein proteins, which some people find
                easier
                to digest than A1 proteins found in other breeds’ milk.
                <br>
                4. Better Taste: Many people appreciate the rich, creamy taste of Jersey milk.
                <br>
                5. Heat Tolerance: Jerseys fare well in warmer climates due to their heat tolerance.
